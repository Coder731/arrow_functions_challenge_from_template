so as not to disturb code in v2 version of file if need references later on.

###### Step 2
Revert to working in combo files.
work on combo-2.js
Bring in relevant code from 
loop-object-in-array-v3.js

##### 12Mar2022 1821h combo-2.js
Add loop with 3 leves

combo-3.js

can work on loop
without losing original idea
