## Naming Conventions

### Use dashes as delimiters

Never use spaces or underscores. Spaces are converted to %20 in URLs or can break an URL when shared. Underscores are difficult to see when the file name is displayed as an underlined link.

### Underscores in python function and variable names

Use the function naming rules: lowercase with words separated by underscores as necessary to improve readability. Use one leading underscore only for non-public methods and instance variables. To avoid name clashes with subclasses, use two leading underscores to invoke Python's name mangling rules.
