#### GitHub browser Editor Keyboard Shortcut

Pressing shift and . on keyboard while on this github page opens vscode in a browser in a new tab, and seems to allow editing directly in the browser without GitPod.

brings up:

- list of potential insertions or changes 
    like: 
    - bold 
    - italics 
    - different heading levels
    - predictive text insertions 
        like or from previously used text

##### Other setup notes
(with

- GitPod Chrome extension
 and
 - VSCode extensions:
    - Kite 
    - Emmet ))
